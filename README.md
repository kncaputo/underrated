# underrated
A personal project by Alyssa Bull and Kara Caputo

## Project Overview 
This movie database app allows users to view movies details, trailers, and average ratings fetched from an API. Upon logging in, a user can rate movies as well. 

After completing a simplified version of this project as part of Module 3 of the Turing School of Software and Design's Front-End Engineering Program, we decided to rebuild the app with dramatically increased functionality, improved UX, and a responsive UI.
